<!-- An autoencoder(AE) is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data encodings in an unsupervised manner. A variational autoencoder(VAE) is a specific type of autoencoder that helps to 'learn' complex probabilistic models based on the input data set. Using the learned representative models (also called latent space), we can generate 'novel' and 'unseen' variations of the learned latent space. In this project, we try to build variational autoencoders for image generation on MNIST,CIFAR10 and CALTECH101 dataset. -->
